Each language folder contains the following files:

Training/development files:

<split>.<mt>.src -- source sentence
<split>.<mt>.mt -- machine translated sentence
<split>.<mt>.hter -- hter between translated and post-edited sentences, capped between 0 and 1
<split>.<mt>.pe -- post-edited machine translation
<split>.<mt>.ref -- reference translation (not pre-processed)
<split>.<mt>.add-labels -- additional labels collected during post-editing:
   -- post-editing time in seconds
   -- number of keys pressed for 10 types of keys (we recommend summing these 10 columns)
   -- post-editor id 

where <split> is either dev or train and <mt> is either smt or nmt.
