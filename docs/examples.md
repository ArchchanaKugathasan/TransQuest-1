# Examples
We have provided several examples on how to use TransQuest in recent WMT sentence-level quality estimation shared tasks. They are included in the repository but are not shipped with the library. Therefore, if you need to run the examples, please clone the repository. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TharinduDR/TransQuest.git
cd TransQuest
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
